# The Dog Pack Project

This project is for exploration on topics in implementing virtual
machines.  No guarantees are made for any of the code contained herein.

So far:

- [White Dog]("whitedog/") A really simple 4 function desk calculator stack machine
- [Yellow Dog]("yellowdog/") A basic stack machine with conditional flow control
- [Green Dog]("greendog/") A basic register machine with conditional flow control
- [Red Dog]("reddog/") Placeholder for a full featured VM with advanced flow constructs
